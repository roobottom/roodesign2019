          Onalytica connects businesses and influencers through a powerful search engine called Discover. Although popular with their customers, they recognised that there was room for improvement in the user-experience of their tool. The goals for this project  were threefold:
          
          1. To identify Discover’s most pressing usability problems — what we called “the low-hanging fruit”;
          2. to validate their current discovery and development process;
          3. to help better define roles and responsibilities within the product and design team.
          
          I spent time interviewing their users — both external clients and internal “power” users. I also conducted one-to-one sessions with designers, product managers and developers.

          Using the general themes which emerged from the user interviews (via an affinity mapping exercise) as pointers, I conducted a full app review — this highlighted different classes of issue that were causing problems in users’ understanding of Discover.
          
          I prioritised the emerging themes so I could present these back as next-step recommendations to the whole team.

I helped Onalytica’s design and product teams improve processes and kick-start a standardised approach to interface design.
