          Onalytica's goals were threefold:
          
          1. To identify Discover's most pressing usability problems — what we called "the low-hanging fruit";
          2. to help better define process and responsibilities within the product and design team;
          3. to empower the development team to quickly and robustly build and iterate Discover's interface.
          
          
          I spent time interviewing their users — both external clients and internal "power" users. I also conducted one-to-one sessions with designers, product managers and developers.

          ### Aligning teams, bottom-up
          
          Using affinity mapping,  strong themes emerged from user interviews. I  used these motifs to put together a full application review — this detailed the issues which were having the most significant impact on users.
          
          Using this visual laundry list, Onalytica's teams were able to have better conversations about specific UX problems. Moreover, presenting findings in this way further raised awareness of users and their needs.

          ### Aligning teams, top down
          
          It was clear that many of the skills and processes they needed to improve the overall usability of their products were already in place. However, there wasn't a single unified vision of how teams should work together from the top.
          
          I gave a presentation to Onalytica's management team in which I outlined a framework process and a set of clearly defined roles they needed to make this process work.

          ### Test and embed
          
          To help embed this new process, I worked alongside Karl Roche, Onalytica's senior UX designer to design, test and refine an updated listing page for Discover. As one of the most common page types in their application, I felt this would provide the most immediate benefit for users and provide a useful benchmark as to how to design and develop going forward.
          
          We created sketches, screen designs and a click-through prototype which enabled us to test with Onalytica's internal "power" users — making adjustments based on their feedback — further cementing an understanding of how a user-centred design process should work across the business.

          In the second phase of work I co-designed and built a front-end pattern library. 
          
          Working alongside Onalytica's design and development teams, I created a custom build of Bootstrap. I built a pattern library interface to enable developers to pick and use components easily. 
          
          All the components compose together, so the pattern library can also be used to create a test new interface combinations quickly.

I helped Onalytica’s design and product teams improve processes and kick-start a standardised approach to interface design.
