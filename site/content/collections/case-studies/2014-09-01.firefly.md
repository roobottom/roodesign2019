          The goal of the design team was to provide the absolute best experience for teachers, students and parents. We were responsible for *what* users saw on screen and *how* they interacted with our product. My challenge was to grow a team that delivered on the goal.
          
          By delineating skills we needed in the team, designers knew what was expected and how they could level-up. This also helped with our hiring — we could crystal-clear about who we needed.
          
          This also gave rise to the two distinct flavours of designer: The **UX Researcher** and the **UI Designer**.
          
          ### Levelling-up
          
          Once clear roles were established, it became much straight forward to identify areas for improvement. However, judging someone's "level" was challenging. 
          
          During a workshop, team members voted on each other's relative skill level and adjusted based on feedback. This led to greater trust amongst team members and a clear path from junior to senior.

          ### Design specialists
          
          In addition to core functions, I created add-on roles that were assigned to designers who showed a particular interest in or aptitude for that skill. It was their job to advocate best practice and for seeing everyone level-up in that area.

          The responsibilities of a design leader are many and varied. But a big part of the job is making people feel valued and supported. I spent the majority of my week ensuring everyone could do their best work.
          
          ### One to ones
          
          One to ones are vital in running a healthy, happy team. I ran weekly hour-long sessions with all of my team with clear timed sections for work catch-up, Objectives and Key Results review and career support.
          
          ### Weekly team meetings
          
          Every week the whole team came together for an hour in a safe space where we shared what we'd been working on and offer feedback.
          
          As the team changed, so did the format of these meeting. Periodically, I'd turn the whole of the meeting over to a "format workshop" to make sure we were talking about the things that people found useful.

          Getting designers and developers working in sync is complicated. There's a balance to be struck between leading the way and being too prescriptive.
          
          I worked with Firefly's cross-discipline teams to create a process that worked for all but could be modified per squad.

          ### What?
          
          We helped to define what we should build through user research and testing. UX Researchers owned this part of the process and split their time between:
          
          * **Generative research**: developing a deep understanding of our users and their needs to create innovative ideas of how Firefly could help them in-line with our mission and strategy ("why").
          * **Idea validation**: testing ideas with real users and their feasibility with internal teams.
          * **Feature validation**: at the end of the process, understanding the impact of recently shipped features on squad-level KPIs.
          
          ### How?
          
          We created solutions to user stories through creative design and testing. UI Designers owned their part of the process and split their time between:
          
          * **Solution ideation**: create ingenious solutions to problems for teachers, parents and students through fail-fast, iterative design.
          * **Solution validation**: testing then iterating solutions with users via increasing fidelity prototypes.
          * **Solution feasibility**: working alongside product managers to ensure that solutions are technically feasible and align with business strategy.

          I believe workshops are an essential part of any design process. At their best, workshops unlock untapped creativity, spark unexpected ideas and facilitate fast-failure.
          
          I've run workshops with internal teams and external clients in many different formats. At Firefly we came to favour a version of Design Sprints as our go-to format. We'd then develop the structure depending on the desired outcome, attendees and time constraints. 
          
          By readily involving team members from other areas of the business, we were able to employ their unique perspectives and evangelise the tools and techniques of design all in one fell swoop.

For 4 years I led the design team at Firefly Learning. We helped thousands of teachers, students and parents, to teach and learn from anywhere.
