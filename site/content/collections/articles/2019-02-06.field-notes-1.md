          ## Landing a project
          
          Last Friday, I met with Andy and Karl from [Onalytica](//onalytica.com). We talked about how I could help them speed up their development cycle.  It seemed a natural continuation of the work I'd started there last year when I helped them to improve their design process. This time, I'm helping them build a front-end pattern library.

          ## Back to the old school
          
          On Wednesday, I spent half a day with Mark at Ooba. Back in December, we'd pitched to redesign a collection of school websites. Today we walked through or proposal via a Skype call with the school's board. It felt like it went well, but time will tell.
          
          I've missed spending time with creative people since leaving Firefly. It was great to hang out with Mark and Nat for the afternoon.
          
          ## Losing a project
          
          The week ended on something of a bum note. We found out late on Friday that we hadn't won the schools project. We're expecting more feedback next week. You can't win 'em all, right? Still, I was already running the discovery workshop in my head.

          ## Reader's digest
          
          ### The new design frontier
          
          Invision published [a new report](https://www.invisionapp.com/design-better/design-maturity-model/) into the state of design maturity. I remember filling in a survey for this when I was leading design at Firefly. 
          
          The report makes for compelling reading. Maybe I've been spoiled by working alongside people who appreciate the power of design. I certainly didn't recognise the description of the "Level 1" companies in many of those I've worked with.
          
          I have it in mind to write a more extended article on the report soon.

My first weekly note. Or periodic-note. Or, perhaps, sporadic-note.
