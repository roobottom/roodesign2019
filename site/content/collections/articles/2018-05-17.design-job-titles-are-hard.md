          When William Shakespeare wrote the immortal line "What's in a name?" he'd obviously never tried defining roles for a design team. It turns out that when it comes design job titles, a rose by any other name may not smell as sweet after all.
          
          For young designers entering the market, there is a slew of titles in the digital product space which makes applying for jobs somewhat confusing. Are you a UX Designer, UI Designer, Visual Designer, UI/UX Designer, Product Designer, Digital Product Designer, Visual Product UX/UI Designer?
          
          Oh boy.
          
          What do these titles mean? Well, in that great tradition of answers to questions that designers ask: it depends. Each company will have a different list of the skills they require when creating user-centred products. Each skill will sit somewhere on a spectrum ranging from research to graphic and motion design and sometimes beyond.
          
          At Firefly, we have the two overlapping disciplines of **UX Research** and **UI Design**.

          Of course, different organisations will have different overlaps and even different roles within this continuum.
          
          I believe that it is this overlapping of skills that has lead to the plethora of design job titles. Teams wish to give some kind of indication in the title of the skills and responsibilities of the role. For me, job title is no longer a clear of indicator responsibilities.
          
          My advice is if you're looking for a job designing user experiences, then look at the role description; it's a much better indicator of expectations than the title.
