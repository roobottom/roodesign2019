    card_title: 'Teams & Processes'
    card_content: |
      Organising modern product, design and development teams into effective units is often challenging. When there's no clear voice leading the way, I help by:
      
      * Assessing team capability
      * Plugging skill gaps
      * Improving inter-team relationships
      * Evolving processes
      * Aligning everyone around a human-centred design approach

    card_title: 'Usability reviews'
    card_content: |
      It's easy to overlook good usability in favour of just getting the product out of the door. My years of hands-on experience makes me ideally placed to:
      
      * Assess the usability of your product
      * Identify issues with the most significant impact
      * Introduce best practice to ensure good usability going forward

    card_title: 'Creativity workshops'
    card_content: |
      The best ideas are often locked-away in people's heads. Either, they don't identify as "creative" or don't know how to articulate their thoughts. I run workshops to help:
      
      * Frame a problem to arrive at unexpected answers
      * Leverage the experience of team members from across your business
      * Find solutions that are cheap and easy to implement

    card_title: 'Design systems'
    card_content: |
      Inconsistent interfaces are a problem. Forcing users to relearn similar interactions leads to frustration. I help design and build pattern libraries and design system that:
      
      * Ensure interface consistency
      * Provide detailed specifications for developers
      * Speed-up the design process — saving time and money
